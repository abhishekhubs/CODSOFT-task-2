# üé¨ Movie Rating Prediction with Python  

## üìå Introduction  
This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** that predicts the rating of a movie based on features such as **genre, director, and actors**. By analyzing historical movie data, the goal is to estimate ratings given by users or critics and gain insights into the factors that influence a movie‚Äôs success.  

The project covers:  
- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Feature engineering  
- Applying regression techniques  
- Model evaluation & performance analysis

## üîÑ Project Workflow  
The end-to-end workflow of this project can be summarized as:  


This process ensures the dataset is clean, transformed into usable features, and applied to regression models for accurate predictions.
